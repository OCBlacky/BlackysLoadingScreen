# BlackysLoadingScreen
A simple loading screen for FiveM with a News Section and Media controls, you also have the option to add your logo and background videos.


# Instuctions

If you wish to add more music in the music files. Rename them to song1, song2 and song 3. If you wish to add more, you will have to do that yourself as I only scripted it for 3 songs.

When adding the background video or logo just replace my current file and make sure the name is the same.

Other than that enjoy and if you find any bugs feel free to DM me on discord blackynz1
